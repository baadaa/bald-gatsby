### Situation

The day before New Year's eve, I felt seriously inspired to create a personal greeting card—realizing that it is all the people I've encountered in life that makes me who I am now.

### Production

It took me ten straight hours to complete this piece from start to finish—_writing, sketching, recording, animating, and HTML email coding_. Sent out via email on the New Year's Eve at sunrise, the video message was extremely well-received from family, friends, colleagues, and clients.
