### Challenge

An internationally renowned interior surface product company was struggling with their multitude of product types and keeping up with outdated legacy <small>CMS</small> system. They offered a myriad of architectural products, and confusing categorization and archaic <small>CMS</small> made it extremely difficult for clients to find what they want and for internal teams to manage inventory and update content.

### Solution

We completely restructured the site user flow and reorganized entire product category system. Each of their product categories were so interrelated in complicated specs that no off-the-shelf <small>CMS</small> could handle, so we proposed a custom-<small>CMS</small> with tailored modules such as product configurator and proprietary collage tools. For in-depth filtering and searching across product portfolio was indispensable for users, we also planned out exhaustive database structure to implement comprehensive functionality. I developed the full site wireframe, designed the user flow, built visual mockups, and created the motion presentation for clients.
