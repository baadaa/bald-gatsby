### Background

After reading John Maeda's blog article “[Life is just a big math problem](https://johnmaeda.medium.com/life-is-just-a-big-math-problem-7c4d823e088f),” I felt inspired to implement this mathematical simulation on my own. It turned out to be a good, fun JavaScript exercise for handling 2-dimensional matrices, and I felt pretty good about the result.
