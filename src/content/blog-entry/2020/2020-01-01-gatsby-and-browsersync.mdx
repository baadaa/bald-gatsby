  Browsersync has been an indispensable tool for many, providing an easy way to
  review changes in real-time both in browser and on mobile devices, and it's
  one of the first packages I'd install on any web projects. So, do I need to
  add this as a dev-dependency for Gatsby projects?
</p>

## What is Browsersync

[The official website](https://browsersync.io/) describes it as _"(a tool for) time-saving synchronised browser testing_". At its barebone, Browsersync makes it incredibly easy to test web projects during development by mirroring the screen on devices and browsers and auto-refreshing them whenever a change occurs.

While there might be other ways to achieve the same results&mdash;e.g. VS Code LiveServer Extension, `http-server` node package, etc&mdash;Browsersync is arguably the most elegant and seamless solution available.

Typically I'd install it globally or locally per project basis as a dev-dependency, and include some additional `npm` scripts in `package.json` as something like below.

```bash
npm install browser-sync --save-dev
```

```json filename:package.json
{
  // ... other stuff
  "scripts": {
    "start": "npm run dev & npm run sync",
    "sync": "browser-sync start --files 'scripts/**/*.js, styles/**/*.*' --proxy '127.0.0.1:9000' --port 9001",
    "dev": "some-dev-command"
    // ... other stuff
  }
  // ... other stuff
}
```

Then I can simply run `npm start` to initiate my `dev` and `sync` command to see something like following.

```
[Browsersync] Proxying: http://127.0.0.1:9000
[Browsersync] Access URLs:
 ---------------------------------------
       Local: http://localhost:9001
    External: http://10.255.251.208:9001
 ---------------------------------------
          UI: http://localhost:3001
 UI External: http://localhost:3001
 ---------------------------------------
[Browsersync] Watching files...
Starting DevelopmentServer
```

I can mirror/sync pages on any browsers on local computer at `localhost` and easily test it on my phone or tablet at its provided `External` address.

As soon as I started working on this Gatsby site, I found myself frequently (_manually_) refreshing the page and soon wanting to test on my phone. Obviously, it's a solved problem&mdash;I could just install Browsersync and tweak the `package.json` file. But do I need to?

## The Gatsby Way

Apparently, I'm not the first person to think about this. And [there's already a solution](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/5801#issuecomment-456890752), which I found through [a blog post](https://asuh.com/gatsbys-hidden-browsersync/).

With no extra dependency installed, you can simply add `-H 0.0.0.0` at the end of `gatsby develop` command. Now after updating `scripts` section of my `package.json` like the following...

```json filename:package.json {5}
{
  // ... other stuff
  "scripts": {
    "build": "gatsby build",
    "develop": "gatsby develop -H 0.0.0.0",
    "start": "npm run develop"
    // other stuff
  }
}
```

Running `npm start` will show me...

```
You can now view b-as-in-bald-2020 in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:8000/
  On Your Network:  http://10.255.251.208:8000/

View GraphiQL, an in-browser IDE, to explore your site's data and schema

  Local:            http://localhost:8000/___graphql
  On Your Network:  http://10.255.251.208:8000/___graphql

```

There you have it. Gatsby's way of doing Browsersync things. No additional dependencies, no lengthy additional commands, just built-in Gatsby option for easy real-time testing.
